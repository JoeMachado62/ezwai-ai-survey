## Email is Failing in Production!

The SendGrid emails are failing with "401 Unauthorized" because Railway doesn't have the updated API key.

## Required Actions NOW:

### 1. Update SendGrid API Key in Railway
1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Click on your service
3. Go to the **Variables** tab
4. Find `SENDGRID_API_KEY`
5. Update it with the new working key from your .env.local file
   (Copy the SENDGRID_API_KEY value from .env.local)
6. Railway will automatically redeploy

### 2. Add Missing Image Variables (if not already added)
